# **Conformer Generation Pipeline User Manual**

---

## **NAME**
**run_pipeline** â€“ A utility for generating, optimizing, and analyzing 3D molecular conformers from SMILES or reference conformer files.

---

## **SYNOPSIS**
```bash
run_pipeline [REF_CONFO_PATH] [SMILES] [OPTIONS]
```

---

## **DESCRIPTION**
The `run_pipeline` utility processes chemical structures into 3D conformers. It optimizes conformers, clusters them based on structural similarity, and analyzes energy and geometry.

### **Key Features:**
- Generates 3D conformers using SMILES from the reference conformer.
- Optimizes conformers and sorts them by energy.
- Clusters conformers based on RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation).
- Outputs detailed analysis in `.sdf` and `.csv` formats.

---

## **OPTIONS**
- **`[REF_CONFO_PATH]`**  
  Path to the reference conformer file (e.g., `.xyz`).  

- **`[SMILES]`**  
  The chemical structure in SMILES format.  

- **`--num-conf [INTEGER]`**  
  Number of conformers to generate.  

- **`--num-clusters [INTEGER]`**  
  Number of clusters to generate from conformers.  

---

## **PRIMARIES**
### **Pipeline Steps**
1. **Input Validation**:  
   Verifies the reference conformer path and input SMILES string.
2. **Conformer Generation**:  
   Creates 3D molecular conformers using RDKit.
3. **Optimization**:  
   Optimizes conformers using MMFF94 force fields and sorts them by energy.
4. **Clustering**:  
   Clusters conformers based on pairwise RMSD similarity.
5. **Representative Selection**:  
   Selects minimum-energy representatives for each cluster.
6. **Output**:  
   Generates `.sdf` and `.csv` files with sorted conformers, energies, and clustering details.

---

## **COMPATIBILITY**
- Python Version: 3.7+
- RDKit: 2023.09.1+  
- Works on Linux systems.

---

## **STANDARDS**
This utility adheres to open standards for SMILES input and chemical file outputs (`.sdf` and `.xyz` formats). Compatibility with standard molecular modeling tools is maintained.

---

## **EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Basic Command**
Generate and analyze 1000 conformers clustered into 20 groups.
```bash
run_pipeline "/path/to/reference_conformer.xyz" "CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C" --num-conf 1000 --num-clusters 20
```

**Output Files:**
- `optimized_conformers.sdf`: All generated conformers.
- `sorted_optimized_conformers.sdf`: Conformers sorted by energy.
- `cluster_representatives.sdf`: Representative conformers for each cluster.
- `cluster_representatives.csv`: Metadata for representatives.

---

### **Example 2: Custom Number of Conformers**
Generate 500 conformers and cluster them into 10 groups.
```bash
run_pipeline "/path/to/reference_conformer.xyz" "CCO" --num-conf 500 --num-clusters 10
```

**Output Description:**
- Conformers representing the molecule `CCO`.
- Clustering results reduced to 10 representative groups.

---

### **Example 3: Analyze Larger Cluster Groups**
Generate 2000 conformers and cluster them into 50 groups.
```bash
run_pipeline "/path/to/reference_structure.xyz" "C1=CC=CC=C1" --num-conf 2000 --num-clusters 50
```

**Use Case:**
For complex molecules, a higher number of clusters is useful for detailed geometric diversity analysis.

---

### **Example 5: Test with Provided Sample File**
Use the pre-prepared reference conformer file to test the pipeline.
```bash
run_pipeline "test_data/sample_reference_conformer.xyz" "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O" --num-conf 1000 --num-clusters 20
```

**Output Location:**
The output files will be created in the working directory, matching the naming conventions described earlier.

These examples demonstrate how to adjust input parameters for various use cases, from quick tests to detailed conformer analysis.
